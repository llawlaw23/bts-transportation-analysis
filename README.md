# üö¶ BTS Transportation Data Analysis Project

## üìå Project Overview

Transportation systems are crucial for the movement of goods, services, and people, and play a vital role in economic growth and public well-being. This project aims to uncover insights and inefficiencies in U.S. transportation data across multiple modes: road, rail, air, and water.

By leveraging BTS data, this project identifies patterns, trends, and actionable recommendations using the **CRISP-DM** methodology.

## üìà CRISP-DM Framework Implementation

### 1. **Business Understanding**
I aim to answer the following analytical questions:

1. Which modes of transportation accounted for the highest total shipping weight and value from 2020 to 2022?

2. How did Shipping weight vary seasonally across different months and years between 2021 and 2022?

3. Which U.S. states contributed most to the volume and value of trade from 2020 to 2024?

4. Which countries contributed most to the volume and value of trade from 2020 to 2024?

5. What was the distribution of trade types across domestic and foreign shipments in 2021 to 2022?

6. How did container type  usage vary by the top 2 modes of transportation  from 2020 to 2024?

7. Were there any trends or changes in trade volume and value by year across different transportation modes from 2020 to 2024?
